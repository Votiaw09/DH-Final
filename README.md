## LGBT Icons, in a Literal Sense

The purpose of this visual essay is to both analyze and especially to bring attention to the exceedingly creative ways that LGBT bars market themselves, with a focus on Green Bay and the Fox Cities. Some logos are subtle, others brazen, and much of the time, unless you knew what to look out for, it may not be apparent that the bar is an LGBT space to begin with.

## The Pink Triangle, and the Napalese Lounge

Bright and whimsical imagery with exceedingly grim origins, the pink triangle originated in Nazi Germany as a way to identify gay men in concentration camps. "Four decades later, in 1986, an American art collective known as the Silence=Death Project repurposed this Holocaust symbol to create its ties around the country"[^1] (Vials, 194-95). The AIDS crisis, joyfully referred to by Reagan's administration as the "gay plague," was seen as "god's solution" to the Republicans' "gay crisis," and had killed up to one in every fifteen LGBT Americans by 1995. In the face of this continued persecution, Avram Finkelstein, Brian Howard, Oliver Johnston, Charles Kreloff, Chris Lione, and Jorge Socarr√°s, the founders of the Silence=Death Project, repropriated this iconography as an identifier of another kind.

The Napalese Lounge, established in 1983 and still running almost fourty years later[^2], has carried on this tradition with its iconic logo, prominently featuring both a rainbow-colored crescent moon and pink triangle. The bar is not only operational, but a pillar of the local LGBT community, organizing monthly drag shows and organizing events. Of the bar logos found throughout the course of this project, it is the only one still operational that displays the pink triangle in its iconography.

## Pink Triangle Cont., Club Cheeks

A handful of bar iconography and logos collected by the UW Green Bay Archive & Area Research Center utilize this pink triangle, with or without accompanying rainbow coloration (comparing this logo to the previous one for "Naps"). The presence of the pink triangle can be considered a kind of code, a signifier to people in the LGBT community that this is a bar 'for them.' LGBT Bars, for a wide variety of reasons that could include their era of operation, location (both city and neighborhood), and intended clientelle, are more or less subtle with this iconography. The Napalese Lounge, for example, is very public with its image, with both the rainbow-adorned logo and the pink triangle displayed in their front windows. Club Cheeks, shown here, was only open for a short time in 1996[^2] and was intended to be a locals-only nightclub whose signage include an ad for their 'first show,' featuring "Miss Gay Great Lakes U.S. of A. At-Large, Celeste Olds." Club Cheeks openly advertised itself as an LGBT space, and unfortunately, it is unknown whether its too-brief tenure was in part due to that openness. As far as the non-triangle imagery goes, the two C's are nestled in a position similar to a big- and small-spoon cuddle, and the coloration derives itself from the bottom three colors of the lesbian flag.

## Pink Triangle (Last), Za's

Mark Mariucci, a Green Bay resident, opened and operated Za's bar from 1989 until its closure in 2000. Za's took over the space previously occupied by Who's, another short-lasting LGBT bar with a five-year tenure, and both owners of the respective bars lamented the transient and taxing nature of owning an LGBT bar. Both bars reported harrassment and violence as ongoing struggles throughout their short lifespans. Ironically, it was an increasingly diverse and tentatively accepting societal shift that lead to these early LGBT bars to struggle; as 'straight' bar crowds diversified, LGBT bars like Who's and Za's found their crowds shrinking. Za's logo is one of the most striking in UW Green Bay's collection; the angular design is striking, and in addition, Mariucci (or his graphic designer!) clevely interpreted the pink triangle imagery into the logo in the form of the A in "ZA'S." After two years of vacancy following Za's closure, new ownership moved in to open XS Nightclub, which is still in operation.

## Rascals Bar & Grill

Similar to Naps, Appleton's own Rascals Bar & Grill is a long-running and openly LGBT bar. It, along with Napalese Lounge, is a rare breed of long-running and ongoing LGBT bars in the Northeast Wisconsin area. Rascals, established in 1992, is well-known for its friendly environment as well as its reputation to local LGBT people as a refuge during tough times. It chooses to mix traditional, blocky, pub-style design with identifiable rainbow highlights, signaling its dual identity as a LGBT space and also as a spot for families to go for a Friday Night Fish Fry. This form of presentation may have contributed to its ability to stay intact throughout a tough era for other LGBT bars.

## Matchbooks

Just as important as the logo for the bar is the paraphernalia, like matchbooks and business cards, distributed to their clientelle. These items can be used as conversation starters, or signals to other people 'in the know.' With some striking exceptions, the imagery and designs of these matchbooks are fairly uniform, with some scrutiny required to discern the bars' target demographics.
