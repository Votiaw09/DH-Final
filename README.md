## The Pink Triangle

Bright and whimsical imagery with exceedingly grim origins. The pink triangle originated in Nazi Germany as a way to identify gay men in concentration camps. "Four decades later, in 1986, an American art collective known as the Silence=Death Project repurposed this Holocaust symbol to create its ties around the country"[^1] (Vials, 194-95). The AIDS crisis, joyfully referred to by Reagan's administration as the "gay plague," was seen as "god's solution" to the Republicans' "gay crisis," and had killed one in every fifteen gay people by 1995. In the face of this continued persecution, Avram Finkelstein, Brian Howard, Oliver Johnston, Charles Kreloff, Chris Lione, and Jorge Socarrás, the founders of the Silence=Death Project, repropriated this iconography as an identifier of another kind.

## Pink Triangle, Cont.

A handful of bar iconography and logos collected by the UW Green Bay Archive & Area Research Center utilize this pink triangle, with or without accompanying rainbow coloration (comparing this logo to the previous one for "Naps"). The presence of the pink triangle can be considered a kind of code, a signifier to people in the LGBT community that this is a bar 'for them.' LGBT Bars, for a wide variety of reasons that could include their era of operation, location (both city and neighborhood), and intended clientelle, are more or less subtle with this iconography. The Napalese Lounge, for example, is very public with its image. Club Cheeks, shown here, was only open for a short time in 1996[^2] and was intended to be a locals-only nightclub whose signage include an ad for their 'first show,' featuring "Miss Gay Great Lakes U.S. of A. At-Large, Celeste Olds." Club Cheeks openly advertised itself as an LGBT space, and unfortunately, it is unknown whether its too-brief tenure was in part due to that openness.
